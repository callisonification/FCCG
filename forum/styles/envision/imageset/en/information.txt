It is not necessary because the imageset buttons are controled by CSS and language/yours/common.php

If you want to change button style you need to change these:

1-) envision/theme/images/button_left.gif and
    envision/theme/images/button_right.gif
(They are background of buttons.If you are not good at CSS, I suggest you keep their width and height.)

2-) envision/theme/stylesheet.css
    .bbbutton { This is colour of the button's link for example,Post a replay }
