    <p>Excessive gambling places a hardship on our legal and prison systems given the frequency of theft, embezzlement, fraud, and other crimes committed. More often than not, police, probation and correction officers, as well as attorneys, public defenders, prosecutors, judges and the criminal justice system as a whole are not familiar with compulsive gambling and/or the impacts resulting from such a diagnosis that lead to crime.</p>

    <p>The FCCG has developed a program: <em><a href="<?=site_url('give_help/programs')?>" title="View Programs Page">A Guide for Legal, Criminal Justice & Court Professionals</a></em> that empowers and educates the judicial system to understand the uniqueness of compulsive gambling and offers suggestions on how to approach sentencing, probationary guidelines and other legal facets when dealing with someone who is addicted to gambling.</p>

    <p>The Council is working to establish collaborative relationships with judges and others within the court system as a means of aiding persons falling subject to crime in order to "cope" with the increased pressures of a gambling habit. The agency has also been advocating the need for the judicial system to develop and institute a "Gambling Court" in Florida similar in philosophy to Drug Court, and is working with judges and others to bring such a program to Florida.</p>
